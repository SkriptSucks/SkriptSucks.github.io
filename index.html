<h1>Java vs Skript</h1>
<h3>Dank website. 10/10</h3>
<p>Skript pros:
<br>* Easy to learn.
<br>* Easy to remember syntax:
<br> - Most code looks like plain English.
<br> - Can be written like a todo list, set of instructions/etc which helps get you into the right mentality for programming.
<br>* Can make use of existing java libraries.
<br>* Can easily be written on anything with a keyboard.
<br>* Do more with less code.
<br>Skript cons:
<br>* Less portable, all servers will have java, but not all will have skript and not all server owners are willing to install it.
<br>* Fewer opportunities are open to you.
<br>* Most likely uses a transpiler:
<br> - Runtime bytecode generation can be expensive, even with the most optimised of libraries.
<br> - If Skripts are compiled on demand then you may end up taking periodic hits whilst the plugin generates bytecode.
<br> - Can easily generate inefficient code, the transpiler can only be as good as the people who wrote it.
<br>* If it doesn't use a transpiler:
<br> - Pattern based matching is expensive, in the long run, even with JIT inlining it can be quite expensive and slow.
<br>* Depends on the community to continue development of both bindings and the actual plugin.
<br> 
<br>Java pros:
<br>* Almost every Minecraft server will be using java:
<br>  - Take it from someone who's tried to make one, rolling fully custom isn't a pretty experience.
<br> - Few public servers use Spigot alternatives like Cuberite.
<br>* Opens an plethora of opportunities outside of Minecraft server development to you.
<br>* The JVM and compiler:
<br>  - Even if you write bad code it may be able to make it less awful.
<br>  - Years of work have been poured into optimising both projects.
<br>  - With control over the code you can optimise it so that JIT can inline methods and make things lightning quick.
<br>* Far more extensible, you can add support for modules within modules within modules if you get bored.
<br>* You're not limited to a specific set of features on the server:
<br>  - To my understanding Skripts can tap into java libraries, but that requires somebody to write bindings and you may not be an expert when it comes to using said library.
<br>* Will almost always have a spot in the world, it runs on too many devices to simply disappear.
<br>Java cons:
<br>* Intimidating syntax for people new to programming.
<br>* Requires a JDK to be compiled:
<br>  - It is possible to bypass this requirement, but that requires slightly more advanced knowledge.
<br>* You can easily write code that performs poorly.
<br>* Pain in the arse to write in "insert favourite text editor".
<br>* One missing semicolon and you're done for.</p>
